**This project is so far only the preparation of creating a portfolio site.**

Technologies that are going to be used:

1. Chakra UI
2. React
3. React hooks
4. Emotion
5. Framer-motion
6. NextJS

I have also configured formatting & code quality tools into the project from the get go.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
